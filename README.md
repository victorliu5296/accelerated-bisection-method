# accelerated-bisection-method
Experiments on applying the Aitken delta-squared acceleration method for faster convergence of sequences in combination with the bisection method for root-finding.

It didn't work very well, I decided to implement a hybrid method of bisection and the secant method. It outperformed bisection in each case, but probably would be worse in ill-behaved functions.

To try it out, you can
